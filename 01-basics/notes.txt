1. Higher Order Functions
    Functions as data
        Functions can be assigned to variables
        Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
        Functions can be returned by other functions

Channels
    Typed
    Channel Read operations are blocked until data is available
    Channel write operation is blocked until a read operation is initiated (non-buffered chanel) (delivery of the data in guaranteed)
    
    In Buffered channel, a write operation can succeed even when a read operation is not initiated
